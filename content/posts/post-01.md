As seems to happen to many people these days, I've recently found myself with an increasing desire to push my thoughts and opinions out into the world via the Internet.
I fought it as long as I could, but here we are.
The urge to let my thoughts be known has always been at odds with my extreme aversion to posting anything on social media, so I spent a long time thinking of a way to compromise.
I made a Medium account and entertained the idea of publishing there, but concerns about platform, production, and ownership persisted.
My only other social media is Twitter, and often I'd find myself drafting thoughts in the form of tweets, but somewhere along the process of forming and refining my ideas, they'd evolve quickly beyond the 280 character limit.
Even short thoughts struggle to find their way out of my Twitter drafts.

I believe strongly in the act of independent publication, both as an artistic practice and as an urgent praxis (see Paul Soullelis' [QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK](https://soulellis.com/work/queerarchivework/index.html) and [Search, Compile, Publish](https://soulellis.com/2013/05/search-compile-publish/)).
In the current moment, the barriers to entry are lower than they've ever been, and the Internet is to thank for that; indeed, arguably, the ethos of the early Internet was largely predicated on the very idea of an open and free dissemination of ideas.
The increasing control of the few megacorporations has posed an existential threat to this core ethos, and Tim Berners-Lee, "inventor of the HTTP protocol and de facto father of the web, has spoken frequently about the need to actively resist web centralization so as to keep his creation in the hands of the people" ([BREAKERMAG](https://breakermag.com/the-decentralized-web-explained-in-words-you-can-understand/)).
The Web 3.0 movement seeks to push back against the technofascism of Big Tech, proposing systems of distribution, rather than centralization.
I would argue that acts of web-based, self-publication outside of the grasp of these corporate platforms is just as urgent.

At the moment, I'm still in the process of developing a better relationship with the web, and thinking about how my actions existing within and subverting these systems.
I'm thinking a lot about how I want to play a role in building the future of the web,

Anyway, at least it's not a podcast.
